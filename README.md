# databaseAssignment
This is an assignment I did from a databases course that tests basic table joins. All the joins work within a reasonable frame of time on this small-medium (smedium) database

ASX-insert and ASX-schema are the rows of the database and schema is the schema, if you copy pasted them into an SQL program then they would create a database. Questions are the questions and answers are the answers. Perhaps it would've been better to have them in the same file but for now they're in two.
